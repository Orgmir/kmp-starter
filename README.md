# KMPStarter - A Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Starter Template

A starter template for a kotlin multiplatform mobile project.

It improves the "New Project" wizard with some personal preferences:

- `Dependencies.kt` file to make it easier to manage your dependencies across all modules
- Latest Jetpack compose for Android
- SqlDelight boilerplate (the `DriverFactory` pattern from their docs)

Run `./starter-setup.main.kts` to change the project name and the root package for all files.
